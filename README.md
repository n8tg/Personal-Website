# Nate Gramer's Personal Website

![Master Site](https://github.com/n8tg/Personal-Website/workflows/Deploy%20Master%20Site/badge.svg?branch=master) [![Deploy Development Site](https://github.com/n8tg/Personal-Website/workflows/Deploy%20Development%20Site/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://dev.nategramer.com) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This is my personal website built with [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/) using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

I wanted to create a website with a build process that I could CI/CD out to cloud providers (AWS in particular). While I'm certainly not a Web Developer, I didn't like the idea of a flat, boring, Bootstrap site on its own.

My goals for architecture are:

- Serverless capability
- Static Foundation
- (Eventual) Dynamic Content
