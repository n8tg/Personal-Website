This website here has been a fun pet project of mine. As I worked my way through an AWS Solutions Associate exam course, I'm using this website as a way to practice what I learn. The site is being deployed through a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to AWS.

Its gone through several re-writes and toolsets. I'm currently using Hugo and the PaperMod theme.
