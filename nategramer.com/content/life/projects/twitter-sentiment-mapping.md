Although the code is long gone, one of my favorite projects mapped the sentiment of tweets around the Iowa campus. I used Stanford's
sentiment analysis API, and piped in tweets that were fed to me via Twitter's API. Not surprisingly, the bars were among the happiest places to be in town.

This project was backed by Python, sqlite, and an AWS EC2 instance.
