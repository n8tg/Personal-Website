In development! I'm working on a Discord bot based on discord.js, implemented in TypeScript. Interacting with Discord's API, it keeps track of message statistics (who gives out the most emojis, frequent chatter, etc.). It also directly interacts with slash commands to allow for nominations to our Comment of the Year Awards, among other functions.
