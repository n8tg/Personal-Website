## A brief recap

I started out in tech as just another kid with a home PC that was frequently broken
in one way or another, usually by my own doing. By the time I reached high school through all my mistakes, I had a solid understanding of networking and computing concepts; I was running servers for a few different multiplayer games. My entry to corporate infrastructure began with the Glenview Park District in 2013. I soaked up as much knowledge as I could from my mentor, a former ISP engineer. From there, the rest is history.
